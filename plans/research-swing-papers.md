# Recent Academic Research on Swing Trading Strategies\n\nNote: \"Swing trading\" is primarily a practitioner term; academic papers often frame it as short-term momentum, mean-reversion, or technical analysis strategies with multi-day holds. Focused on empirical studies with backtests suitable for algo bots, emphasizing indicator combinations, ML enhancements, risk management. Selected top recent papers from arXiv, journals (past year where possible).\n\n## 1. A Hybrid AI-Driven Trading System Integrating Technical Analysis, Machine Learning and Financial Sentiment for Regime-Adaptive Equity Strategies\n**Authors:** Akshay Ajith et al.\n**Year:** 2026 (arXiv:2601.19504)\n**Key Findings:** Hybrid model combines trend-following (EMA, MACD), mean-reversion (RSI, Bollinger Bands), sentiment (FinBERT), ML signal generation (XGBoost), and regime filtering (volatility/returns). Outperforms benchmarks in volatile/regime-shift markets by adapting exposure.\n**Strategies:** Multi-modal: directional momentum + price normalization + psychological factors + ML predictions + dynamic risk adjustment.\n**Performance:** Backtested on 100 S&P 500 stocks over 6 years (4 train, 2 test) using Backtrader; 135% return over 24 months (portfolio $100k to $235k), superior Sharpe ratio, lower drawdowns vs. S&P 500/NASDAQ-100.\n**Automation Adaptations:** Fully implementable in Backtrader/Python; regime-aware for bots, integrates structured/unstructured data seamlessly.\n\n## 2. A Comprehensive Analysis of Machine Learning Models for Algorithmic Trading of Bitcoin\n**Authors:** Syed Qaisar Jalil et al.\n**Year:** 2024 (arXiv:2407.18334)\n**Key Findings:** Evaluated 41 ML models (21 classifiers, 20 regressors) for BTC price prediction; RF and SGD excel in profit/risk balance under volatility.\n**Strategies:** Price direction/regression prediction for buy/sell signals; combines ML metrics (MAE, RMSE) with trading (PnL %, Sharpe).\n**Performance:** Backtesting + forward + real-world; top models show positive PnL, high Sharpe; highlights model robustness.\n**Automation Adaptations:** Straightforward for crypto bots; extend to stocks/swings via similar feature engineering (TA indicators).\n\n## 3. Can LLM-based Financial Investing Strategies Outperform the Market in Long Run?\n**Authors:** Waylon Li et al.\n**Year:** 2025 (arXiv:2505.07078)\n**Key Findings:** LLM timing strategies overperform short-term but fail long-term (20+ years, 100+ symbols) due to biases; conservative in bulls, aggressive in bears.\n**Strategies:** LLM-generated timing from unstructured data; emphasizes trend detection + regime-aware risk over complexity.\n**Performance:** Deteriorates vs. passive benchmarks long-term; FINSABER framework reveals biases.\n**Automation Adaptations:** Use LLMs for signal gen but add regime filters; backtest rigorously across universes/time.\n\n## 4. Predictive modeling of foreign exchange trading signals using machine learning techniques\n**Authors:** (ScienceDirect)\n**Year:** 2025\n**Key Findings:** ML models (Ridge, KNN, RF, XGBoost, GBDT, ANN, LSTM, GRU) outperform MA crossover in signal prediction.\n**Strategies:** ML-based vs. momentum; daily/intraday signals.\n**Performance:** Backtests 2000-2023 on 6 major forex pairs; superior returns/risk.\n**Automation Adaptations:** Ideal for forex swing bots; feature-rich ML pipelines.\n\n## Additional Practitioner Empirical: QuantifiedStrategies.com Swing Trading Backtests (2026)\n10+ backtested strategies (e.g., mean reversion, breakouts) with code/settings; strong risk-adjusted returns over decades. Useful for algo prototyping despite non-academic.\n\nSources: arXiv searches (freshness='py'), abstracts/snippets. Full papers recommended for details.
